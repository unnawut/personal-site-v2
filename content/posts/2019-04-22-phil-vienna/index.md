Despite so many cafes in Vienna, Phil, in my opinion, is the best one by far. I came here for a few hours of relax and work for both days of my stay in Vienna.

Phil calls itself a coffee shop, a bar, a book store, a vintage furniture store (most if not all furnitures used in the shop are available for sale), a small movie shop (sells DVDs) and a small record shop (sells vinyl).

It is located only a 4-minute walk from Museumsquartier subway in a relatively quiet district, makes it really easy to access and quite peaceful.

The fact that it is open from 9AM - 1AM is also a big plus (although last order is around midnight). Looking for hungry and a place to read a book in the morning? Phil is open. Looking for a beer and some night-owl work? Phil is open.

Their food is also delicious and comforting. Here's a photo of Phil Sandwhich which I dearly loved.

If you have some time to spend in Vienna and looking for a cafe to sit and relax, I recommend trying Phil out.
