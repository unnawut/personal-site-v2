This article, [The Psychology of Money](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/), was recommended to me by [Ino Murko](https://github.com/InoMurko). It's a great read on personal investment.

The author described 20 flaws, biases, and causes of bad behavior when people deal with money, which are listed below. Check them out, but believe me, the full article is much more eye-opening, especially his examples which hit me really hard.

1. Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same coin.

2. Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a reward.

3. Rich man in the car paradox.

4. A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult, resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding rewards that come from current decisions.

5. Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

6. Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is the lifeblood of progress.

7. The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the most reasonable stance.

8. Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear terms.

9. Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian thinking to achieve above-average results.

10. An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean rules but loose and unpredictable trends.

11. The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.

12. A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

13. Underestimating the need for room for error, not just financially but mentally and physically.

14. A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are.

15. An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.

16. Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.

17. A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.

18. Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the inherent complexities of everything involving money.

19. Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.

20. The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your future.
