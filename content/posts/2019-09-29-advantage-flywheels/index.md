[Max Olson](http://www.maxolson.com/), a product strategist at [Mashgin](https://www.mashgin.com/)
wrote an article about [Advantage Flywheels](https://futureblind.com/2019/08/03/advantage-flywheels/),
a way to represent business values in terms of feedback loops, making it easy to visualize how those
values reinforces each other and become the company's business advantage.

While advantage flywheels are not new, reportedly first mentioned in James C. Collins'
[Good to Great](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865.Good_to_Great) since 2001, I find
Max Olson's examples for Wal-Mart, Amazon, Microsoft and Google the easiest to unnderstand
compared to abstract examples in other sources. Here is an example for Microsoft.
