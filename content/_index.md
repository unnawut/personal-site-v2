Hi. My name is Unnawut. You may also know me by my Thai nickname, O (pronounced a neutral "Oh").

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [OmiseGO](https://omisego.network) on the Integration team.
I make sure that concepts as fresh as blockchain and decentralized exchange are accessible
by businesses and individuals worldwide. My primary work at OmiseGO is the development of
the open-source, Elixir-based [eWallet](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet) server.

You may find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/unnawut/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@unnawut), [TED](https://www.ted.com/profiles/437296), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/unnawut) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unnawut).

For the geeks out there, you'll probably know me better through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2716927/unnawut) and [Github](https://github.com/unnawut).

Secure ways to contact me can be found at [keybase.io/unnawut](https://keybase.io/unnawut).
